1st Steps:- 
install pytrhon version
install and configure fast api
setup Virtual Environment
select the Virtual Environment from Command palette of venv>scripts>python.exe
h:/Codes/FastAPI/venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1 for run venv (venv)
if its not showing switch paython to pre release

for fastapi:
pip install[all] // it will install all fastapi
pip freeze // for checking package which installed
uvicorn app.main:app --reload // for running the live server

for installing driver to connect database:
pip install psycopg2
import psycopg2 // to connect the database to API


for git commit :-
git checkout
git add .
git commit -m "comment"
git push dev

for ORM :- 
first install pip install sqlalchemy
and it needed database driver like psycopg2

for security Oauth2:- 
pip install passlib[bcrypt] // to install passlib & bcrypt
and imported from passlib.context import CryptContext in utils.py file

for JWT Token authentication:-
for creating tokens we have to install -> pip install "python-jose[cryptography]"
for that we have to make Oaut.py for JWT error -> from jose import JwtError, jwt


for database migration we ccan use alembic:- 
pip install alembic
then init > "alembic init <alembic as name>"
and then import the Base from app.models import Base in "env.py" file in alembic file and use in metadata = Base
and then go to alembic.ini(its not required ) better connect in env.py file connect the database in sqlalchemy url as connected in database.py file like postgresql+driver name:// 


for package requirement:-
for making requirement file - "pip freeze > requirements.txt"
for package install from requirements file - "pip install -r requirements.txt"
